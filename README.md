# Best-Buds-Frontend
>Link: https://bestbuds-app.herokuapp.com/

Best Buds is a personal plant tracking full CRUD functionality web application, created using the MERN Stack. Users are able to make a personal account and enter their plants' information in the app where it is neatly displayed. Attributes such as light needs, water needs, general descriptions, and when a plant was last watered can all be tracked within Best Buds.

The front end was created entirely with React, with a single-page web app approach. Modals and conditional rendering are used to display different information depending on a user's actions, which in turn ensures a fluid user experience. The back end was implemented using MongoDB and Node.js.
